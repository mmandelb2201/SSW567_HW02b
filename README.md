While designing the code, I felt that it was important to make my design as simple as possible. This allows any issues to be able to be easily debugged. But as my focus was writing for the tester, I made a few changes to my code. First, the function is simple to use and understand how to use. Call it with the username as the input and it returns a dictionary. This allows the function to be determinate, so the tester can write unit tests easily. As they will know the output from the parameter for the function. Next, the function returns a dicitonary. This allows and key value to pair to be accessed easily. This also makes writing unit tests easy. 

The biggest challenge I faced was circle ci. Circle CI does not make accessing a sub directory easy. After much time on stack overflow I was not able to figure it out. Therefore, I put both the tests in the same directory. After that, testing the program was fairly simple. As I designed it in a way for unit tests to be written easily, writing the tests did not take much time.
